\item{department}{Character string. Department code (e.g., \code{"CS"}) used to
identify the department for all courses in the XML.}
}
\value{
A \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} containing course information with columns:
\itemize{

\item \code{year}: Character. Academic year
\item \code{subject}: Character. Subject code
\item \code{code}: Character. Course number
\item \code{title}: Character. Course title
\item \code{description}: Character. Course description

\description{
Parses XML data containing Stanford University course information into a structured
data frame. The function processes detailed course data including basic course
information, section details, schedules, and instructor information.
}
\details{
The function processes course data in several stages:
\enumerate{
\item Locates all course nodes in the XML using XPath
\item For each course:
\itemize{
\item Extracts basic course information (ID, title, units, etc.)
\item Extracts section data including schedules and instructors
\item Joins section data with basic course information
}
\item Adds department code to all courses
}

Course sections may include:
\itemize{
\item Term information
\item Class components (e.g., lecture, discussion)
\item Schedule details (days, times, locations)
\item Instructor information
\item Enrollment data
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
xml_data <- xml2::read_xml("cs_courses.xml")
cs_courses <- process_courses_xml(xml_data, "CS")
}

\seealso{
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=extract_basic_course_info]{extract_basic_course_info()}} for basic course data extraction
\item \code{\link[=extract_section_data]{extract_section_data()}} for section and schedule processing
