\title{Fetch raw department list from Stanford ExploreCourses API}
\usage{
fetch_departments_raw()
}
\value{
An \link[xml2:oldclass]{xml2::xml_document} object containing the raw departments XML.

The XML structure includes:
\itemize{
\item Root \code{schools} element
\item Multiple \code{school} elements, each containing:
\itemize{
\item \verb{@name} attribute: School name
\item Multiple \code{department} elements, each containing:
\itemize{
\item \verb{@name} attribute: Department code
\item \verb{@longname} attribute: Full department name
}
}
}
}
\description{
Makes a direct API call to retrieve the complete list of Stanford departments
and their associated schools. Returns the raw XML response without any
processing or transformation.
}
\details{
This function is a thin wrapper around \code{\link[=make_api_request]{make_api_request()}} specifically for
the departments endpoint. It retrieves the current academic year's department
structure including:
\itemize{
\item Schools
\item Departments within each school
\item Department codes and full names
}

The department list is relatively static, changing only when Stanford's
organizational structure changes.
}
\section{API Endpoint}{

Uses the \code{DEPARTMENTS_ENDPOINT} constant, which points to:
\verb{https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/?view=xml-20140630}
}
